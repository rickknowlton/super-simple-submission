# Super Simple Submission

This is a super simple application for submitting form data. It consists of a simple Express server and a basic HTML form. 

> K.I.S.S. - Keep it simple, stupid! Great advice. Hurts my feelings every time.

## Prerequisites
Not a lot going on here, but make sure you have `Node.js` installed on your machine!

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.

## Usage
1. Start the server by running the `npm start`.
2. Open another terminal window and navigate to the root directory.
3. Run the `npm serve` command to start the HTTP server and open the index page. This will start the HTTP server and automatically open the application in your default web browser. If the browser doesn't open automatically, you can manually visit http://localhost:8080.
4. Fill out the form with the desired values for "Field 1" and "Field 2".
5. Click the "Submit" button to submit the form data.
6. The server will process the submitted data and respond with a success message that will take the place of the "Submit" button.
7. Check the terminal running the server to view the submitted data logged in the console. You can also see this data logged in the browser console via Inspector Tools.
